            Our team competes in the FIRST robotics competition as Team 1515.
            Team 1515 was founded in the fall of 2004 under the leadership of
            Former Principal of Beverly Hills High School Dr. Dan Stepenosky,
            member of the School Board Dr. Myra Demeter, Beverly Hills High
            School Chemistry Teacher Charles Lee, and parent Eileen Kahn. Under
            their leadership, Team 1515 grew to become a well-known team. Our
            team continued to flourish with the help of parent Eileen Kahn, who
            became a credentialed teacher to keep the program in existence.
            Thanks to the strong leadership and dedication of our teacher, John
            Castle, our team is moving full S.T.E.A.M ahead. With new student
            leadership, more efficient subdivisions, and fresh thinking, MorTorq
            is reaching for the stars. Currently, we have 42 students enrolled,
            along with many other affiliated with our robotics business team. In
            2019, we had the honor to be awarded the prestigious Chairman's
            Award and traveled to the FRC International Competition with our
            registration fee sponsored by NASA. The 2022-2023 FIRST season will
            be our teamâ€™s ninteenth year competing.

                In the 2022 season, our team participated in the LA and Ventura
                regionals and won up to quarter finals in both tournaments. We
                were twice awarded the FRC Imagery Award for outstanding
                attractiveness in our engineering and visual aesthetic of both
                our robot and team appearance.

                Our 2020 robot had a revolver type magazine, a feature that
                allowed us to carry five balls at a time. The robot could intake
                balls, place them into the magazine, and then used a solenoid to
                direct the ball into the two wheel shooter. It also had a
                climber mechanism that utilized a hook. The swerve drivetrain
                allowed us to move rapidly and avoid obstacles on the field.
