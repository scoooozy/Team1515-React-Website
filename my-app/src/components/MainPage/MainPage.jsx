                  1515. Team 1515 was founded in the fall of 2004 under the
                  leadership of Former Principal of Beverly Hills High School
                  Dr. Dan Stepenosky, member of the School Board Dr. Myra
                  Demeter, Beverly Hills High School Chemistry Teacher Charles
                  Lee, and parent Eileen Kahn. Under their leadership, Team 1515
                  grew to become a well-known team. Our team continued to
                  flourish with the help of parent Eileen Kahn, who became a
                  credentialed teacher to keep the program in existence. Thanks
                  to the strong leadership and dedication of our teacher, John
                  Castle, our team is moving full S.T.E.A.M ahead. With new
                  student leadership, more efficient subdivisions, and fresh
                  thinking, MorTorq is reaching for the stars. Currently, we
                  have 42 students enrolled, along with many other affiliated
                  with our robotics business team. In 2019, we had the honor to
                  be awarded the prestigious Chairman's Award and traveled to
                  the FRC International Competition with our registration fee
                  sponsored by NASA. The 2022-2023 FIRST season will be our
                  teamâ€™s ninteenth year competing."

                allowed us to carry five balls at a time. The robot could intake
                balls, place them into the magazine, and then used a solenoid to
                direct the ball into the two wheel shooter. It also had a
                climber mechanism that utilized a hook. The swerve drivetrain
                allowed us to move rapidly and avoid obstacles on the field."
